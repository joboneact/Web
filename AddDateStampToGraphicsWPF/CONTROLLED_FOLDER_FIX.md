# WINDOWS CONTROLLED FOLDER ACCESS SOLUTION

## The Problem
You're seeing "Controlled folder access blocked" because Windows 10/11 ransomware protection is preventing the app from writing to protected folders (Documents, Pictures, Desktop, etc.).

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Disable Controlled Folder Access (Temporary)
1. Open **Windows Security**
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**
3. Click **Ransomware protection**
4. Turn OFF **Controlled folder access**
5. Run your app
6. Turn it back ON when done

### Option 2: Add App to Allowed List
1. Open **Windows Security**
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**
3. Click **Ransomware protection**
4. Click **Allow an app through Controlled folder access**
5. Click **Add an allowed app**
6. Browse to: `bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\AddDateToGraphicWpf.exe`
7. Click **Add**

### Option 3: Use Safe Folder (Recommended)
Save images to a folder that's NOT protected:
- C:\Temp\
- C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\
- Any folder you create outside of Documents/Pictures/Desktop

### Option 4: Run from Different Location
Copy images to a non-protected folder first, then process them there.

## The App Will Now:
1. Detect controlled folder access blocks
2. Suggest alternative save locations
3. Provide clearer error messages
4. Offer to save to a safe temporary location
